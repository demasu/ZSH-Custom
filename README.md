# Description
This is a repository for my zsh files that are used to set up custom aliases and other configuration details.

Files in here will be read by Oh My ZSH when the zshrc is read. They will be loaded in alphabetical order.

# Example
The following example can also be found in the `example.zsh` file.
```
# You can put files here to add functionality separated per file, which
# will be ignored by git.
# Files on the custom/ directory will be automatically loaded by the init
# script, in alphabetical order.

# For example: add yourself some shortcuts to projects you often work on.
#
# brainstormr=~/Projects/development/planetargon/brainstormr
# cd $brainstormr
#
```
